> #Tile-matching puzzle

A demo Tile-matching web game built using [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3). The name **SameGame** is a reference to the game originally release in 1985 by [Kuniaki Moribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SameGame).

## Quick Start


Install with npm and start the app:

```shell
npm install
npm run start
```

## Features

* :iphone: Cross platform. Game and assets scale is auto adjusted based on screen size and pixel aspect ratio.
* :wrench: Can change game settings. Such as number of tiles and tile types, score and difficulty.
* Test buttons lead to different game ending scenes.
* :microscope: A lab scene as a playground to experiment new ideas.
* Tiles implemented using Phaser [Arcade Physics](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Physics.Arcade.ArcadePhysics.html) engine.

## Gameplay 

**Goal:** 

- Eliminate all tiles .

**Rule:**

- Match 2 or more adjacent tiles of the same type to collect points.

**Endings:**

- Ending I (game over): Current score is lower than target.
- Ending II (good ending): Current score exceeds target with no tile left.

## Developing

To develop the app:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hl778/SameGame-Phaser3.git
cd SameGame-Phaser3
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

Optionally, run `npm update`. 

### Building

To build the app:

```shell
npm run build
```

The built app is at `./dist` directory including all assets.

> The app includes 2Â KB of CSS files which can be safely omitted if needed. They are used to importing fonts in game. 

Optionally, to run the built app:

```shell
npm run start:prod
```

### Testing

To run tests:

```shell
npm run test
```

Alternatively, view the test results in CLI, run:

```shell
npm run test:cli
```

> It is recommended to view the test in a web interface. The CLI has limited test cases. 



## Code Logic

The code logic separates into two parts:

<img src="public/assets/docs/diagram1.png" alt="diagram1" width=30%/> 

Each scene is a class. Assets are generated by `Assets Builder` class. Assets animations are created by `Assets Animator` class. A `global setting` object stores variables for debugging and easy access.

### Generating Tile Map

Tile map is generated at the start of each level. The approach is to select a starting tile, mark its successive adjacent tiles as the same type, if they have not been marked. The logic can be separated into parts:

1. Initialize each tile with a value of -1 to indicate it has not been marked.
2. Select a starting tile has the value -1, decide the tile type to be marked and  the number of steps to take.
3. From the starting tile, go to its first neighbor has a value of -1, this may be at its top, down, left or right, mark it as the same type of the starting tile, decrease the number of step by 1. Repeat the step from the new neighbor until step count is 0. Then, repeat the step 2 to 3 until all tiles are marked.
4. If reach dead end in any direction for a given tile, mark this direction to indicate it is a dead end.
5. Take dropped tiles and shifted columns into consideration.

</p> 

### Shifting Columns

A variable stores the number of tiles left per column. The columns will be shifted towards the left if there are empty spaces. 

### Locating Adjacent Tiles

Starting from a clicked tile, it uses [breadth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) to locate adjacent tiles.

### About Arcade Physics engine

The game can be created without a physics engine. The reason to use it is to create a potential to expand the game into a physics-based game.
